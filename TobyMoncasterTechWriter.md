# GesundheitsCloud technical writer home task 

### Produced by Toby Moncaster [toby@moncaster.com](mailto:toby@moncaster.com)

-------

My contribution to this task is contained in the file **README2.ml**. It consists of the following improvements to the existing README:

- Added an introduction explaining what ZeroKit is and giving a very brief overview of how it works.
- Explained the concept of tresors.
- Added examples for the other 2 API calls (*ValidateUser* and *ApproveTresorCreation*).

*NB, the examples for ValidateUser and ApproveTresorCreation are quite likely to be wrong as I have never programmed GoLang. However I ensured they at least are the correct type of call to the correct ZeroKit API endpoint.*

If I were able to talk with one of the developers I'd like to include a similar README for the methods included in the file **signer.go**.
